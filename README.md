The following instructions are for a Linux system. For a Windows system, you should use the Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2). For a Mac system, you may need to install libcairo2 using different commands, but the setup after that point should be the same.

You should start in the root directory of the project.

0. Ensure you have `mamba` installed (or change the commands below for conda): https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html
1. Unzip env/candas.zip and env/nupack-4.0.1.7.zip into the env/ directory
2. Use the following commands to set up the environment.
    ```bash
    # From the root directory.
    cd env
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install libcairo2-dev  # needed only for saving SVGs
    mamba env create -f env.yml --prefix ./can_manuscript
    conda activate can_manuscript
    pip install -e candas
    pip install -U nupack -f nupack-4.0.1.7/package/
    ```
3. Open Jupyter Lab in a browser from the root directory for the project
    ```bash
    cd ../  # You should now be back in the can_paper/ directory
    jupyter lab
    ```

    * A browser window should open; if not, copy-paste the full hyperlink that appears into a browser.
    
4. Run each notebook
    * Open the .ipynb file in the `code/` subdirectory for each figure, and click "Run All". You may want to first remove all files from the "graphics" subdirectory to verify that they are freshly generated.
    * Keep in mind that some notebooks, in particular the ones for Fig 2, 7A, and ED1, may require 32-64GB of RAM and thus may not run to completion on a personal computer.

# Notes on each figure
## Figure 8
Run the _Fig8_febrile_signature_patient_data.ipynb_ notebook before _Fig8_febrile_signature_experimental.ipynb_. The _JG073 Processed patient data.csv_ and _JG073 Bayesian Logistic Regression Results.pkl_ files are generated by the _patient_data_ notebook.
